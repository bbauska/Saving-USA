# Saving-USA
Steps to saving the USA from grifters, billionaires and religious nuts.
It all started with morbidly rich men (it was all men back then) who wanted to use the 
threat of a “communist menace” to gut the union movement to increase their own corporate 
profits and CEO pay.

The founding premise of the modern conservative movement tracks back a generation before 
Stormer’s book to a Republican thought leader named Russell Kirk. He laid it out in his 
1951 book The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot, as I detail in The Hidden History 
of American Oligarchy.

Kirk argued that the middle class was becoming a threat to America; without clearly defined 
classes and power structures — essentially without the morbidly rich in complete control of 
everything — he worried that society would devolve into chaos.

The opening chapter of his book was about Edmund Burke, the Irish conservative who wrote, in 
1790, that hairdressers and candlemakers should not be allowed to run for political office or 
even to vote:

“The occupation of a hairdresser or of a working tallow-chandler cannot be a matter of honor 
to any person — to say nothing of a number of other more servile employments. Such descriptions 
of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state; but the state suffers oppression if such 
as they, either individually or collectively, are permitted to rule. In this you think you are 
combating prejudice, but you are at war with nature...”

Kirk and his followers essentially predicted in 1951 that if today’s “hairdressers and working 
tallow-chandlers” — college students, women, working-class people, and people of color — ever 
got even close to social and political power at the same level as wealthy white men, there 
would essentially be a communist revolution in the US, handing us over to Stalin and his 
Politburo.

(Keep in mind, this was when racial segregation was legal and brutally enforced, the voting 
age was 21, campuses were almost entirely all-male, both abortion and birth control were 
illegal in most states, and women couldn’t open checking accounts or get credit cards without 
a husband’s, brother’s, or father’s signature.)

Throughout the 1950s, Kirk and his warnings of the dangers of an activist middle-class developed a 
small following; the most prominent of his proponents were William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry 
Goldwater. Most Republicans, though, considered him a crackpot.

But when the birth-control pill was legalized in 1961 and the Vietnam War heated up a few 
years later, those marginalized groups Kirk had warned his wealthy white male followers about 
began to rise up in protest.

Kids were burning draft cards, women were burning bras, and Martin Luther King Jr. was leading 
a movement for racial justice that the white power structure blamed for American cities burning. 
Gay liberation was also having a moment.

Meanwhile, the Arab Oil Embargoes of the 1970s had lit the flame of inflation, and unionized 
workers were striking all over America for wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of 
living.

Wealthy white conservatives freaked out as the morbidly rich promoted the idea that America 
was experiencing a “moral decline” that could only be fixed by ending the union movement and 
other “liberal” causes that shared the union movements’ populist goals.

They became convinced that they were seeing Kirk’s prophecy play out in real time on their 
television screens every night: the “communists” — those uppity racial minorities, women who’d 
forgotten their “rightful place in society,” students who objected to Vietnam, unionized 
workers, and gender minorities — were on the verge of “taking over” America.

These five movements all hitting America at the same time got the attention of conservatives 
and Republicans who had previously ignored or even ridiculed Kirk back in the 1950s. Suddenly, 
America’s most powerful and well-known conservative commentators (like William F. Buckley Jr.) 
were telling Republicans that Russell Kirk was, indeed, a prophet.

They’d finally found a politically acceptable “hook” to destroy the wealth of working-class 
people and transfer trillions into their own money bins: fear of communism and a prophesied 
social decay caused by an activist middle class.

The Republican/Conservative “solution” to the “crisis” these five movements represented was 
put into place in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was sworn into office: the explicit goal of the 
morbidly rich white men funding the so-called Reagan Revolution was to take the middle class 
down a peg to end the protests of the ’60s and ’70s, restore “social stability,” and increase 
corporate profitability.

Their plan was to declare war on labor unions so wages could slide back down again, end free 
college across the nation so students would live in fear rather than be willing to protest, 
and increase the penalties Nixon had already put on drugs so they could use those laws 
against their scapegoats, particularly the hippy antiwar protesters and Black people demanding 
an end to police killings. They also wanted to outlaw abortion, to put women “back in their 
place.”

Thus, Reagan massively cut taxes on rich people and raised taxes on working-class people 11 
times. For example, he put income taxes on Social Security and unemployment payments, and put 
in a mechanism to track and tax tips income, all of which had previously been tax-free but 
were exclusively needed and used by middle-class people.

He ended the tax deductibility of credit-card, car-loan, and student-debt interest, 
overwhelmingly claimed by working-class people. At the same time, he cut the top tax 
bracket for millionaires and billionaires from 74% to 25%. (There were only a handful of 
billionaires in America then, in large part because of previous tax policies; today’s 
democracy-destroying explosion of billionaires followed Reagan’s, Bush’s, and Trump’s 
massive tax cuts on the rich.)

Reagan declared war on labor unions, crushed PATCO in less than a week, and over the next 
decade the result of his war on labor was that union membership went from about a third of 
the American workforce when he came into office to around 10% at the end of the Reagan/Bush 
presidencies. It’s just now beginning to recover from its low of 6% of the private workforce.

He and Bush also husbanded the moribund 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT, 
which let Clinton help create the WTO) and negotiated NAFTA, which Clinton signed and thus 
opened a floodgate for American companies to move manufacturing overseas, leaving American 
workers underemployed while radically cutting corporate labor costs and union membership.

And, sure enough, Reagan’s War on Labor cut average inflation-adjusted minimum and median 
wages by more, over a couple of decades, than anybody had seen since the Republican Great 
Depression of the 1920s and ’30s.

The billionaire’s investment in taking the middle-class down a peg was paying off by 
orders of magnitude.

Had Reagan not destroyed the nation’s unions, the median American income today would be 
well over $100,000 a year, minimum-wage households would have a family income of $86,000, 
and a single wage-earner would still be able to buy a house, a car, send the kids to 
college, and have a decent retirement (as my dad did, working a union job for 35 years in 
a tool-and-die shop).

Instead, CEOs today keep all that money for themselves and their investors.

And Reagan’s War on Colleges jacked up the cost of education so high that an entire 
generation is today saddled with more than $1.5 trillion in student debt: as predicted, 
many aren’t willing to jeopardize it all by “acting up” on campuses.

The key to selling this campaign of impoverishment to the American people to help out the 
billionaire class was the idea that the US shouldn’t protect the rights of workers, 
subsidize education, grant women equal rights, or enforce Civil Rights laws because, 
conservatives said, all of those things were aspects of “socialism.” And if America 
embraced socialism, we may as well be ruled by the Soviet Union.

As Reagan told us in his first inaugural, government “socialist” programs were not the 
solution to our problems, but instead were the problem itself.

He ridiculed the formerly-noble idea of service to one’s country and joked that there 
were really no good people left in government because if they were smart or competent 
they’d be working in the private sector for a lot more money.

He even told us that the nine most frightening words in the English language were, “I’m 
from the government, and I’m here to help.”

Following Lewis Powell’s 1971 memo, throughout the 1970s and 1980s Republican billionaires 
built a massive infrastructure of think tanks and media outlets to promote and amplify 
Reagan’s message that government supports of any sort for poor or working-class people 
were simply gateway drugs to socialism and, inevitably, communism.

It so completely swept America that by the 1990s even President Bill Clinton was saying 
things like, “The era of big government is over,” and “This is the end of welfare as we 
know it.” Limbaugh, Hannity and other right-wing radio talkers were getting millions a 
year in subsidies from billionaire-funded groups like the Heritage Foundation. 
Billionaire-owned Fox “News” today carries on the tradition.

It had been a pretty good scam for the billionaires who owned the GOP and wanted, back 
in the 1950s, to stop the union movement that was forcing them to share their profits 
with their workers.

First, they terrified Americans about communism and socialism, then convinced about half of us 
that those things came straight out of “liberal” social and economic movements.

Unions, feminism, acceptance of the queer community, civil rights, minimum wage increases, and 
even regulation of corporate behavior would, they told us, all lead to Soviet-style tyranny.

So, to save America from herself, Reagan gutted the American middle class, transferring over 
$50 trillion in wealth from working class people into the money bins of the morbidly rich.

By 2016, Americans were starting to figure out that they’d been screwed — and that Hillary 
Clinton’s husband had been in on it by continuing Reagan’s policies and doubling-down on free 
trade — and were loudly demanding change.

Into this maelstrom walked Donald Trump, proclaiming himself the savior of the country. In the 
GOP primary he pointed out how corrupt his opponents were, particularly Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, 
and destroyed them, one after the other.

For the general election in 2016, he changed his tune and ran on what was traditionally a 
Democratic platform, saying he was going to bring jobs home, end so-called “free trade” 
policies, raise taxes on the rich so much that “my friends won’t talk to me anymore,” and 
make sure every American had free or low-cost healthcare and access to an affordable college 
education.

They were all lies — something Trump had become adept at during his business career — but 
they worked and sucked in disaffected workers who knew they’d been screwed but weren’t sure 
who did it to them or why.

So here we are.

We have an open fascist and apparent friend of authoritarian Russia as president after being 
convicted by a jury of his peers on 34 felony charges, having previously been adjudicated as 
responsible for sexual abuse (the judge called it “rape”) and fraud.

He’s putting into place people and policies that could turn America into an authoritarian 
nation like Russia or Hungary, and apparently wants to re-align the United States away from 
NATO and the EU and toward Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.

We are literally facing the authoritarian future that John Stormer was warning us about back 
in 1964. Only instead of “communists” in the State Department, it’s a billionaire president 
with the avowed goal of ending union rights and locking up or using the Army with live ammunition 
against those who protest his policies.

And it all tracks back to wealthy conservatives funding a project in the 1960s to scare Americans 
about socialism and communism so they could stop the union-fueled growth of wages that were 
cutting into their profits.

Perhaps none dare call it treason. But I do.
